# HR-ANALYTICS-DASHBOARD

 What I Learned from Analyzing an HR Analytics Dashboard 

Today, I deep-dived into an HR Analytics Dashboard and gained valuable insights into how organizations track and manage their workforce more effectively. Here's what stood out to me:

 Key Takeaways:
ðŸ”¹ Attrition Rate: 16.12% overall attrition, with male attrition (150) significantly higher than female attrition (87).
ðŸ”¹ Active Workforce: Out of 1,470 employees, 1,233 are still active, and the average employee age is 37.
ðŸ”¹ Job Satisfaction: Sales Executives had the highest headcount (326), but a notable portion rated satisfaction as 1 or 2 â€” an area of concern.
ðŸ”¹ Age Group Trends: Employees aged 30â€“36 dominate the workforce, with the highest attrition seen in the 25â€“34 group.
ðŸ”¹ Department-wise Attrition: Sales sees the highest attrition (56.12%), while HR has the lowest (5.06%) â€” a cue for potential retention strategies in sales.
ðŸ”¹ Education Background: Life Sciences and Medical fields contribute the most to attrition, raising questions about fit, stress, or expectations.

 What I Learned:

Attrition isnâ€™t just a number itâ€™s connected to age, gender, department, job satisfaction, and even educational background.

Data-driven HR helps pinpoint where to act: from improving job satisfaction in key roles to re-evaluating workload in high-attrition departments.

Dashboards like this are critical for strategic workforce planning, identifying red flags early, and enhancing employee experience.

 Takeaway for Professionals:
If you're in HR, Business Analytics, or Organizational Leadership â€” harnessing dashboards like this can turn data into powerful decisions.
